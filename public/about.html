<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a publicity assistant at a charity that caters for disabled children, young adults and their families.
   I am responsible for their social media and website updates. </p>

<p>I am a beginner at web development. This is something I have always wanted to do.
  I am hoping to dedicate more and more time to this hobby and eventually make full use of this new skill.</p>

<p>I am also a keen baker and I love cooking, paper crafts and photography.</p>
